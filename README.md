## Title: Object Distinguishing and Arranging System
######  A micro controller based arduino oriented autonomous system which can differentiate between different objects using image processing and pass them through different gates according to their similarity. In this project, an image processing algorithm called SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm is used.
